    <h1>Welcome to the Customer Data Processer</h1>

    <h2> Here we will cover a range of useful facts about the customer data set:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>How many invalid customers are there?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>How many duplicate customers?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>How much was the last purchase for over $200?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>How many small (&lt;$25), medium($25&lt;$75) and large($75+) transactions are there?</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Which customers had a transaction over $200</h3></li><br><br>
    </ul>
